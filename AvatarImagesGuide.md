# Avatar Images Guide

This document provides guidelines for creating or sourcing the avatar images needed for the ABG AI Chatbot.

## Required Avatar Images

You'll need three avatar images representing different moods:

1. **happy.png** - Representing the happy/excited mood
2. **neutral.png** - Representing the neutral/default mood
3. **sad.png** - Representing the sad/upset mood

## Image Specifications

For the best results:

- **Format**: PNG format with transparency
- **Size**: Recommended 200x200 pixels (square)
- **Style**: Consistent style across all three avatars
- **Subject**: A cartoon/animated character with ABG aesthetic

## Placement

Place all avatar images in an `assets` folder in the root directory of your project:

```
project-root/
├── assets/
│   ├── happy.png
│   ├── neutral.png
│   └── sad.png
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── app.js
```

## Creating Avatar Images

If you don't have avatar images ready:

1. **Use an AI image generator** like DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion to create custom avatars
2. **Search for free avatar packs** on sites like Freepik, Flaticon, or Icons8
3. **Commission a designer** to create a custom set of avatars for your project

## ABG Style Suggestions

For an ABG-inspired avatar, consider including:
- Stylish makeup (winged eyeliner, lashes)
- Fashion-forward appearance
- Accessories (hoop earrings, necklaces)
- Modern hairstyles
- Expressive facial features

Remember to ensure you have the proper rights to use any images you source from the internet!
